# Mission-to-Mars

## Background
Web-scraped images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and its titles using tools like BeautifulSoup and Splinter. Stored the scraped data on a Mongo database, used a web application to display the data, and altered the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

## Notes
In order for the data scraping to be performed successfully with longevity, the reference websites from which the data is extracted from should be verified for working order.
